# CMS Resource Optimization Project

## Overview

The CMS (Customer Meter Service) Resource Optimization project for National Grid aims to enhance the efficiency of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meter installations. This Lean Six Sigma project addresses challenges such as gas module unavailability, frequent customer opt-outs, and 'Unable to Complete' (UTC) scenarios. The project leverages Power BI for comprehensive analysis and visualization to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Executive Summary

The project aims to improve the AMI meter installation process by addressing critical challenges such as gas module unavailability and frequent customer opt-outs. Lean Six Sigma methodologies were employed to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Acknowledgements

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Professor Gary LaPoint for his invaluable guidance, and to our project champions, James Walter and Matt Johnson, for their support and direction throughout the project.

## Project Charter

The project charter outlines the mission, problem statement, business case, and goals for the CMS Resource Optimization project. The primary focus is on reducing the costs associated with revisits and improving overall service efficiency.

## Power BI Analysis

The Power BI analysis component of this project provides detailed insights and visualizations to support decision-making and operational improvements.

### Smart Meter Deployment Analysis

- **Overview**: Analyzes the distribution and installation trends of smart meters, encompassing both electric and gas modules.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts depicting meter types by OP Centre and Route levels, providing insights into the categorization of households based on their energy sourcesâ€”electric only, gas only, or dual-fuel (both electric and gas).

### Household Energy Classification

- **Overview**: Classifies households into distinct categories based on their energy sources, facilitating targeted insights into energy consumption patterns.
- **Visualization**: Detailed charts illustrating the count of different meter types by OP Centre.

### Operational Optimization

- **Overview**: Focuses on minimizing "Unable to Complete" (UTC) scenarios, employing strategies to overcome obstacles that hinder successful installations.
- **Visualization**: Line charts and graphs analyzing UTC trends across OP Centres and by ZIP codes, helping to identify high-impact areas and months with predominant UTC occurrences.

### Energy Classification & Cost Estimation

- **Overview**: Provides a breakdown of routes based on OP Centre, revealing which areas have the highest route prevalence and categorizes routes based on meter types.
- **Visualization**: Tables and graphs representing the count of meters of different types for each Bill Cycle by Route and OP Centre.

### Key Objectives

1. **Smart Meter Deployment Analysis**: Investigate the distribution and installation trends of smart meters, emphasizing variations in meter types across different counties and cities.
2. **Household Energy Classification**: Classify households into distinct categories based on their energy sources, facilitating targeted insights into energy consumption patterns.
3. **Operational Optimization**: Address and minimize instances of "Unable to Complete" scenarios, employing strategies to overcome obstacles that hinder successful installations.

## Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as UTC rate, opt-out rate, and revisit rate measure the efficiency of the installation process and customer satisfaction.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan outlines strategic actions to control UTC incidents, improve scheduling, engage customers pre-installation, and provide necessary tools to technicians.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

The cost-benefit analysis evaluates the financial implications of various improvement strategies, highlighting their impact on efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall project costs.

## Control Plan

The control plan includes strategies to minimize revisits, optimize project costs, and ensure adherence to best practices, contributing to a more efficient, customer-centric approach to AMI meter installations.
